Captain Falcon predictably takes centre stage in a massive and pretty engaging plot taking place over nine chapters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndeed, story mode is more than a gameplay diversion and evolves into a specific training mode that will see players forced to perform certain manouvers and master techniques. Story mode is designed to make you a more complete racer and it works absolutely.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe scope of F-Zero has been hugely expanded from the somewhat closed offerings of the past. Racers can now be customised to an unbelievable extent, with the complete garage mode included in the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis offers everything form customisable liveries in the decal-editing suite to specific parts to adjust the handling and performance of each ship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGran Turismo in space. Perfect!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdd to this a multiplayer mode that offers four-player split screen mode, with individual player recognition, that sees no slowdown or noticeable graphical degradation even when pushed to the absolute limits of what should be possible and you?ll find that F-Zero GX offers one the most complete and visually stunning racing games the world has ever seen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, did we mention that it?s very, very fast?
